Collection Of Machine Learning Projects:

This repository is divided into three parts: 1. Datasets 2. Applications 3. Theoretical Models

Datasets contains analysis of different and lots of large datasets.

Applications contains different systems or apps which uses or demostrates machine learning or data science concepts into real time uses.
