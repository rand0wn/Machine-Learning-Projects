#This dataset of size n = 51 are for the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the United States (poverty.txt). 
#The variables are y = year 2002 birth rate per 1000 females 15 to 17 years old and x = poverty rate, which is the percent of the stateâ€™s population living in households with incomes below the federally defined poverty level.
